📄 Web Description 

Real Estate Marketplace is a CRUD-based web application built with Express, MongoDB, and EJS. It allows users to submit property listings, view other listings, and manage their own posts. Admin users have additional privileges, such as approving or rejecting listings to ensure quality control.

This project was built to practice full-stack development, RESTful routing, session-based authentication, and authorization concepts learned during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program.
